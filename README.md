# 1.How would you familiarize yourself with your work in a situation where all your colleagues and your boss are preoccupied?

I have that experience when I worked at IBM. The first week when I joined IBM, all my colleagues and my boss were preoccupied and they were busy working on one release, I would approach familiarizing myself with my work by leveraging my past experiences and technical skills. Firstly, I would thoroughly review any documentation or existing code related to the project to understand the current state and requirements. 

Additionally, I would utilize online resources, such as technical documentation, forums, and online courses, to fill any knowledge gaps that I may have. For example, in my previous role in Thomson Reuters, when joined the team, I knew that our project is deployed on AWS and I didn't have any cloud experience at that time, so I started to read the documents on AWS website to make me have a overview pages of all the services that AWS provided. At last, I were in charge of all the infrastrue design and deployment on AWS and make our project release successful.

Furthermore, I would seek out any available resources within the company, such as knowledge documents/confluence pages or tools, to expedite the learning process. By taking these steps, I aim to quickly get up to speed with the project requirements and contribute effectively towards achieving our team's goals.

# 2.Do you have experience with documentation? if so, how do you approach it?

Yes, I have experience with documentation throughout my career as a Software developer Engineer and Devops engineer. In my previous role at Thomson Reuters, I was responsible for maintaining technical documentations for AWS infrastruct part. The document is clear about how we design the AWS infrasture, how we do the deployement and some troubshooting tips. This not only enhanced team productivity as developers spent less time troubleshooting due to clearer instructions, but also make the new joiners farmiliar with our project quickly.

Furthermore, I were use Git to track document changes, ensuring that all updates were properly documented and easily retrievable. By implementing this process, it make the team members to access the most up-to-date information efficiently.

I also maintained documents in confluence pages about the technical implement details for the big new features and security reports. This confluence pages make team clear about logic for the new features and make my boss clear about our production's security status.
