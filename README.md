#How would you familiarize yourself with your work in a situation where all your colleagues and your boss are preoccupied?

I have that experience when I worked at IBM. The first week when I joined IBM, all my colleagues and my boss were preoccupied and they were busy working on one release, I would approach familiarizing myself with my work by leveraging my past experiences and technical skills. Firstly, I would thoroughly review any documentation or existing code related to the project to understand the current state and requirements. 

Additionally, I would utilize online resources, such as technical documentation, forums, and online courses, to fill any knowledge gaps that I may have. For example, in my previous role in Thomson Reuters, when joined the team, I knew that our project is deployed on AWS and I didn't have any cloud experience at that time, so I started to read the documents on AWS website to make me have a overview pages of all the services that AWS provided. At last, I were in charge of all the infrastrue design and deployment on AWS and make our project release successful.

Furthermore, I would seek out any available resources within the company, such as knowledge documents/confluence pages or tools, to expedite the learning process. By taking these steps, I aim to quickly get up to speed with the project requirements and contribute effectively towards achieving our team's goals.
